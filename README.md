🎓 Hello, I'm **Gael Rivera** [@gael-rs](https://github.com/gael-rs), a student of **Software Engineering** at **Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas**.

📂 This repository is a collection of code developed during my courses at the university. It contains projects, exercises, and assignments completed week by week in my academic journey.

📚 Below is a list of courses where the codes in this repository will be related:
- Algorithms
- Discrete Mathematics *(Proyect)*
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Computer Architecture *(Landing Page and Frontend Web Application)*

👍 I believe these resources will be beneficial for fellow students and software engineering enthusiasts who want to delve deeper into this exciting field! 

*Feel free to explore and learn with me.* 👻
